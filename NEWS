* 0.1.1 - <2014-01-24 Fri>

** Bugfix: Grammar files are not shipped in the tarball anymore
When generating a tarball with "make dist", the built grammar files
are not shipped anymore. They're built against a specific syslog-ng
version, and as such, are not portable to another version of it. The
grammars need to be rebuilt, and shipping them prevents that.

** Bugfix: Don't depend on recent glib
When glib is too old, the $(state) template function gets disabled
now, instead of the build failing.

** Feature: Lua destination
This new feature allows one to write destination driver scripts in
Lua. Example scripts are provided in modules/lua/.

* 0.1.0 - <2013-12-28 Sat>

Initial public release.
